			<!-- Honoring 1 -->
			<div class="honoring1 ind-hon">
				<h3 class="honoring1">Involved</h3>
				<p class="honoring1">Mama is the kind of mom who cheers the loudest during your sports tournament, or the one who fights wars for you when she sees you hurt, or the one who stays up late at night with you to help you with your project. She is always ever strong yet kind and supportive, unyielding yet understanding. She may be imperfect, but maybe more involved moms like her are what the world needs today when being indifferent is the norm.</p>

				<h3 class="honoring2">Understanding</h3>
				<p class="honoring2">First of all, I honor you po for being a mom who sets family as your number one priority despite the busy schedule you have. Thank you for helping with all our problems be it acamedic related or not  kahit na ikaw mismo maraming quotations or work na ginagawa. Second, for being the emotional backbone in our family especially at times na nagkaka misunderstanding sa atin. I honor you for always choosing to see the good in people even if sometimes it comes to a point na umaabot na ng extreme measures. Third, for pushing us to achieve our dreams and become a better person. Thank you mama for always pushing us to aim high and for encouraging us whenever we fail. Lastly, for the unconditional love you continue to shower us with. I am truly blessed to have a mother like you, and I’m pretty sure any kid would think so too. Sobrang lucky namin na may patuloy na nagmamahal at nagaaruga saming magkakapatid and I thank God for you everyday. Happy Mother’s day mama! Love you!</p>
				<h4 class="honoring2">Love, Manta</h4>

			<div class="honoring3 ind-hon">
				<h3 class="honoring3">Patient</h3>
				<p class="honoring3">Happy Mother's Day to the best mother ever. Sorry po kung minsan snob po ako or pasaway tsaka kung hindi kita nabigyan ng gift the past mother's days or birthdays. Thank you po sa lahat ng effort na ginawa mo para lang problems won't get in the way. I know that medyo distant ako ngayon pero Ma, lagi mo pong tatandaan na mahal pa rin kita. Kung nagagalit man ako sa'yo alam ko naman you're just looking out for me and sobrang na-aappreciate ko efforts mo bilang isang ina. Lagi mo lang tatandaan na mahal pa rin kita. Love you, Ma!</p>
				<h4 class="honoring3">Love, Bibing</h4>

			<!-- Honoring 5 -->
			<div class="honoring5 ind-hon">
				<h3 class="honoring5">Steadfast</h3>
				<p class="honoring5">You are underappreciated for what you have done, for what you have been doing and for whatever good dreams and plans you have for your children; not to mention the heartaches, the tears you shed, the physical sufferings, the lack of sleep and other sacrifices you have to bear in the process. In spite of it all, we honor you for unceasingly understanding and loving us all. You bear the source of joy in our home and you will always be in our hearts forever. We love you, really. We pray that we can show it to your more often.</p>
